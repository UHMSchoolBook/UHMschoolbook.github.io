            <li>Messaging doesn’t appear for new users: When a new user signs in into the app for the first time they can't see the messaging option. It fixes on its own when they log out and log in again.

                <h2>Feedbacks from the Testers:</h2>
                <h3>Participant A:</h3>
                <p> If the searching speed for finding the user improves the app would be better, also I hope you can add the picture option to your messenger. Also, If you can link this application to Laulima that can retrieve all of my courses from that site and show in this app it would be perfect because I don't want to add all of my courses individually to this application. It doesn't give me a good feeling. The other thing I want to mention is the lack of users. If more users use this app then I can find many students in the search bar in messenger. Also, If this app has the ability to find any unregistered user and the ability to send messages to them it increases the rate of this app. Messages don't work for the first time after account creation.</p>
                
                <h3>Participant B:</h3>
                <p> The experience of using the App was overall good. Everything worked seamlessly and seemed easy going. But It would be really exciting if the app could fetch my course information from laulima. There should be an option to search and add the clubs. The market place should have an option to message the poster of the item.</p>
                
                <h3>Participant C:</h3>
                <p> The courses and clubs should appear automatically from my records in UH. If the clubs don't appear on their own then there should be an option to search the clubs. Picture adding  and account deletion options should be added. Overall the app was really good.</p>
                
                <h3>Participant D:</h3>
                <p>The app is really useful and applicable if it runs smoothly. It had some bugs when I tried to send messages. If I can upload my image on the sign up page it would be perfect. I think this app would be perfect if it has more users.</p>
                
                <h3>Participant E:</h3>
                <p> Make the UI more colorful. The Messaging option didn;t appear when Login for the first time, it fixed after I logged in again.</p>
                
                <h3>Participant F:</h3>
                <p>The app is really well built and has almost all necessary features for its scope. I would just suggest adding a group search option and a way to add pictures in the messages and feed.
