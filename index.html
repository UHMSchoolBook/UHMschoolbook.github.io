            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Whenever a new student starts their journey in a university, their first challenge is to create
                connectivity with other students. Even older students face this issue in the form of new courses and
                clubs. The motivation behind this app is to decrease the gap between students on campus while allowing
                various socializing opportunities designed specifically for the students of UHM.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="goals">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>The goal of the “UHM-SchoolBook!!” is to improve connectivity in student communities by providing a
                platform that is specifically designed for students, especially for a particular campus. This app has
                options to interact as individuals, groups, and members of classes with each other. There are
                Marketplace, House sharing, and messaging modules to alleviate the college experience of every student.

                <li><h4>Missing Message option in Marketplace: (The Issue has been Solved in the latest Version) </h4> There is no way to message the poster of an item up for sale
                    in the current version. But users can search by the poster's name in the messaging section to
                    contact them.

                <li><h4>Messaging doesn’t appear for new users: </h4>When a new user signs in into the app for the first time
                    they can't see the messaging option. It fixes on its own when they log out and log in again.
